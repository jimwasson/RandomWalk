# RandomWalk
Generates a random location within 100 miles of the user’s current location. Every hour thereafter it generates another location within 2 miles of the last random location that tends toward the user’s current location. The locations are stored (up to 48) and the sequence can be replayed. Each new location is displayed on the map. If more than 48 locations are stored, the oldest will be replaced.
